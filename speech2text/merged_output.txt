Please call Stella.  


Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  


Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  


She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 


When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 


The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 


There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 


People look, but no one ever finds it. 


When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 


Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 


Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 


To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 


The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 


The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 


Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 


Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 


Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 


The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 


The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 


If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 


This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.


Johnson was pretty low.


Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.


They should be so lucky.


Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.


They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.


It's a matter of balance.


They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.


I would love it.


It is marvellous.


Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.


But it may take some time to confirm the findings.


Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.


It was fit for royalty.


I was scared.


Dancing was her life.


I suspect the latter.


You must always attempt to raise the bar.


But it took a lot of bottle.


We will push.


It is urgent.


The judge said.


It is difficult for Ali.


But it might have done.


The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.


They had to explain it.


Here's a clue.


We were surprised to see the photograph.


It's the big omission.


Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.


It's very odd.


Because we do not need it.


It's not pretty, but it's effective.


This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.


That's the truth.


That is very hard, alone.


The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.


The problems are a result of that shortfall.


You do not change overnight.


People love to see this stuff.


He was popular.


I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.


Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.


It is like a river running by my home.


We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.


There is an element of racism in Scotland.


Painful, but only because it's true.


That was the easy election.


There could be a way back.


Then followed a bout of flu.


The price cuts are really exciting.


I had my suspicions.


It was chaotic.


It is a job creation scheme.


He is now resident in England.


I've got the shirt.


Today she has been released.


What has changed ?


That is bound to happen.


I will miss him.


It's all going to clear the debt.


She had kept the news from him.


No progress has been made.


Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.


Now the system is right behind us.


Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.


It is a lifeline.


Today I couldn't run on it.


However, it did not end that way.


This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.


I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.


Then came the crunch.


The oil companies would be asked to contribute.


I wish I had put on a brighter tie.


They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.


It was mayhem.


They were outside the circle.


It was a good performance.


We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.


There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.


That is no use.


It was really enjoyable on Saturday.


While they went on holiday, we got the contract.


He pleaded for caution.


He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.


I don't have many friends.


You had better believe it.


It's not fair.


We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.


Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.


Maybe this battle has been.


Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.


Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.


This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.


It is rubbish.


That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.


An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.


That's all right then.


I'm so angry.


Child abuse is a dreadful thing.


It has removed a bit of guilt.


Despite the result, it was still a great moment.


The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.


Offered the gold medal, he declined.


That first victory made a huge difference to my career.


I am now unemployed.


If not, a deal could take many months.


You've got to be vigilant.


Our intentions are real.


They took a risk.


The goals were good.


What will happen then ?


I am totally devoted to this job.


He is severe.


She died at her home.


I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.


They did very well.


The home side didn't stand a chance.


We want to see the maximum of change.


It was deployed in the Gulf War.


Crucially, though, United were still alive.


The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.


She had gone to the Catholic school.


It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.


It was by the numbers.


I was in daily contact.


They were later discharged from hospital.


This latter point is hugely important.


It is an attitude of mind.


They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.


We have to move forward.


Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.


We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.


Tell it like it was ?


It is not too late to get on board.


That must be left to the Parole Board.


Again, we were lucky.


Waiting times for these services are too long.


It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.


We've made a couple of albums.


My life has been destroyed.


They thought they had found a home.


It became a book by itself.


I always felt they played for me.


You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.


First and foremost, the game is entirely different.


Blair's response was weak.


It's the real thing, for sure.


However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.


The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.


The clarity is vital.


I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.


Everyone can be bought.


A career as a doctor is on hold.


Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.


It is the whole package.


I've been there.


Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.


They receive a high profile in the media.


We did everything by the book.


I wish I could say something.


The procedure is the same in all cases.


But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.


I wanted to put myself on the line.


I came home by ambulance.


The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.


The conference is the first test.


The service from the other players was super.


He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.


On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.


The sisters also became the top two players in the world.


A deadline is still essential.


We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.


It's a mixture of everything.


We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.


I don't want to use it.


Now, it's all right.


There was an e-mail.


That's the day job.


Feel the heat ?


He is slightly confused.


She should not be blamed.


His third goal was superb.


He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.


It's not ideal.


He seemed to lose his focus.


He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.


The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.


Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.


It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.


That has been the easy part.


We've got the bronze.


Mental health is a massive issue.


At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.


It was good fun.


What was the main difference ?


I am immensely sad.


I'd never seen a play about me.


It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.


But she was.


Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.


We were awful.


However, no further action was taken by police.


And thought we would get away with it.


It is set in Paris.


The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.


It's quite nice.


It's quite a line-up!


It's a lovely, lovely film.


The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.


Broke the birdie record.


He claimed the government had lost the plot.


She is well balanced.


A change in that position would require a decision by the council.


Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.


He says that he is no different from any other man.


Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.


We did not compete with any other local farmer.


I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.


Some families have even requested to leave the city.


It's a record label, not a form of music.


A friendship that will endure.


I can't get a job.


He said he intended to push for a judicial review.


For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.


The bottom line is that we had to get a win.


One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.


However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.


The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.


Blood samples were taken.


They want to shut the Scottish Office.


That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.


Of course, that is not the whole story.


The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.


Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.


Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.


He is a young man with a new deal.


He was also married with two children.


Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.


Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.


Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.


She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.


They wanted the club to make money.


Finally, he paid for the movie.


Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.


It's a way of life.


The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.


I am an estate agent.


The record companies have gone through the floor.


They were on holiday in Egypt.


It was a privilege to work for him.


It happens from time to time.


He looked very sharp.


Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.


I saw it at a ruck.


They were also beside themselves.


The attacker died in the crash.


The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.


A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.


Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.


He was obviously very genuine.


These figures are truly awful.


He should have won.


He has retired.


What has altered ?


I thought it was my only chance.


Nothing is safe.


He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.


They are wrong.


It is a road of death.


The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.


We are in the end game.


We are now looking at the degrees of injury.


He was solid.


Special measures were needed.


There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.


I never thought it would take this long.


We are a peaceful people.


Kids are terrible.


It should be equal.


Craig is a major concern for us.


The home team had an amazing start.


For the moment, our position remains the same.


Referees are easy targets.


Davis is very supportive, as a director.


However, the groups denied the claims.


I came into this world with nothing.


We think all other measures are not exhausted.


Off with their heads.


It's not long enough.


My view has now completely changed.


They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.


We agreed to disagree.


It could have gone either way.


He was then replaced by Ross.


Horses are drawn by ballot.


I'd like to take the plunge.


Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.


She did not attend the courtroom.


It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.


His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.


The team for the first game could be this one.


They haven't got a hope.


Who will do it ?


Gaelic provision continued to be good.


That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.


He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.


He has to learn.


Tiger is the exception.


Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.


That is the very reason why it was so vital.


I could hardly move for the next couple of days.


Chambers said he would accept the place.


Everything was an effort.


The boat was fantastic.


Like his acting, it was an accident.


It is long gone.


On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.


That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.


He had played well in that central role.


It's not that clear-cut.


She is free.


It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.


I kept going for her.


You must have a government and a good civil service.


But the real problem is the closure of the export market.


It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.


However, it was well worth the wait.


It benefits the whole family.


He has seen the past.


It was one in the afternoon.


To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.


We will be homeless.


The scene is about this ?


Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.


Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.


The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.


It was a double tragedy for the family.


For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.


The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.


They have not done so this season so far.


I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.


Well, the big day has arrived.


Five members were disciplined.


Talks are progressing.


There is no signature.


I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.


That left a bad taste in my mouth.


It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.


Ms McNeill was killed on impact.


It has moved on in the last week.


That's the name of the game, though.


You thought it was a headache.


Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.


A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.


The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.


I can lead by example.


I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.


But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.


Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.


It will probably take me just days to spend it.


We knew nothing about it.


My house was shaking at the time.


This is a huge confidence boost.


We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.


We should have known.


Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.


I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.


You wanted the evidence.


Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.


It was that bad, that low.


I was very young.


We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.


Please call Stella.  


Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  


Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  


We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  


When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 


The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 


These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 


There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 


People look, but no one ever finds it. 


When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 


Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 


Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 


To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 


The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 


The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 


Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 


Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 


Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 


Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 


The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.

This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.


We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.


Is this accurate?


They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.


Because we do not need it.


Life was like a timetable.


Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.


It was clear.


Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.


I came to complete.


President Bush is at war.


Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.


I was scared.


It was ugly.


It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.


It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.


The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.


A neighbour said.


We need to chat.


The boy is no longer with us.


I hate the word.


That should do it.


It's a blessing.


The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.


As she explains.


Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.


He had no enemies.


I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.


But the law is very clear on this.


For the meantime, though, the signs are good.


We were surprised to see the photograph.


Next league matches Celtic.


It's very odd.


The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.


It is not great art.


George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.


There was a battle there.


Scotland had great assets.


There will be tough opponents to this report.


Have a look at our accounts.


Sounds like The Sixth Sense?


There is an element of racism in Scotland.


I was just trying to win the golf tournament.


It's all I can do.


There could be a way back.


They do not work for Glasgow City Council.


The price cuts are really exciting.


Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.


I had my suspicions.


She died in hospital two hours later.


It was chaotic.


Is there a new way forward?


I've not thought about it.


People must remain vigilant.


Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.


It is not long term, but I need time to recover.


It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.


It may well have been.


He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.


He seems to be pleased with the picture.


Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.


I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.


It's never too late.


Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.


Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.


Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.


Today I couldn't run on it.


We must look forward.


It is an old family habit.


He was possessed


She told The Herald.


Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.


The peace process will be buried!


The oil companies would be asked to contribute.


They are now divorced.


They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.


It was mayhem.


However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.


Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.


We have every respect for Michelle.


That time is not now, however.


I didn't play well last year.


For these people, the ruling is very welcome.


They will want to perform well.


They had to be cut from the wreckage.


I did not think about the Ryder Cup.


It is normal.


I was fighting for my life, I thought.


I don't have many friends.


It's a shame.


It was the eighties.


We do not expect any surplus.


Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.


It's not a new concept in jazz.


We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.


I'm delighted about that.


Does this mean.


This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.


He did his job.


You can spend money on housing.


That's all right then.


I was furious.


It has removed a bit of guilt.


His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.


It's terrible that he has died the same way.


So the European elections are extremely important.


Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.


Who will attend?


The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.


The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.


Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.


They made such decisions in London.


Our intentions are real.


It is also well received.


What will happen then?


It's not true.


I feel very grateful with everything.


We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.


Nobody in the world can get away from him.


He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.


We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.


There is a lack of chemistry.


That could mean the difference between life and death in action.


It is like a football team.


That group reported just before Christmas.


He will emerge as a world leader.


It opens the door to the Champions League.


They did very well.


It became a book by itself.


But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.


The weather forecast isn't good.


There's a sense of excess in the novel.


For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.


There's a pause.


He can do no wrong.

I've learned from my mistakes.


A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.


I've put my own money into this project.


However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.


I lost my head.


You are not going in blind.


Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.


As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.


And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.


My life has been destroyed.


There was no hint of scandal.


Treatment is not an issue with these people.


I feel like my game has come a long way.


We wanted it left for a wee while.


However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.


It's quite a routine.


There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.


In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.


Everyone can be bought.


It is minute.


They need to look after themselves.


What has caused the demise of singing?


One was a lawyer.


My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.


It was an odd affair, in many respects.


Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.


Saturday is gone.


I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.


Last night was a key episode.


We must keep our feet on the ground.


The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.


Off I went.


There would appear to be no motive for the attack.


He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.


Ferguson should take note.


The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.


It's just awful.


We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.


IT S all in the hair.


We have an election in eight days.


But I am a worried man.


This gives a financial incentive to switch.


Saddam Hussein is a devil.


He knows a lot.


He is slightly confused.


Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.


We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.


I am delighted for Simon.


It had all been arranged.


A Grampian Police spokesman said.


We have got to get it right.


However, Dundee deserved to win this game.


I might come back.


His death was a tragic accident.


It's just a place to open it.


He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.


Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.


William Hague delighted his party.


At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.


We played them off the pitch.


She really suffered for her art.


He demanded to speak to the boss.


Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.


Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.


I think he's the favourite, no question.


Broke the birdie record.


They had no children.


It is set in Paris.


Well, they were the unlucky ones.


The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.


On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.


John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.


But it's a subtle process.


The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.


My future is in the marathon.


Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.


A change in that position would require a decision by the council.


They may yet have the last laugh.


You can feel at home in China.


It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.


I should think so, too.


We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.


I didn't need to watch it on the video.


He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.


I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.


We need to move away from the culture of long hours.


He said he intended to push for a judicial review.


He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.


I watched a game.


They are interior designers and architects.


There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.


they fail to engage.


It is a mark of respect from the inmates.


I would have the hammer in the crowd.


He thought he had a month to cross the street.


He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.


Blood samples were taken.


He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.


It's very nice.


Frankly, we should all have such problems.


Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.


We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.


And Michael was just great.


We're in shock.


Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.


Our objective is to tackle poverty.


One knows the feeling.


She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.


She looked so young.


It was a privilege to work for him.


For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.


He looked very sharp.


You've got to have both sides.


Who did the recruiting?


Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.


Well, he can do it.


It shows a contempt by him for the industry.


It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.


He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.


The results are sometimes contentious.


He should have won.


A new school will be built.


Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.


That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.


What has altered?


The home was now under new management.


Graeme was prepared.


I thought it was my only chance.


However, the snow was welcomed by some.


It just came into my head that day.


They are wrong.


Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.


It's just not funny!


I am very happy to be here.


The plot is minimal.


It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.


A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.


This is the culture change in medicine.


and that another interested body should have an option to buy.


They were fantastic.


I never thought it would take this long.


In fact, they have the opposite effect.


They wanted the club to make money.


Kids are terrible.


Henman has been warned.


It should be equal.


Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.


The home team had an amazing start.


It is out there.


They had a confession.


Davis is very supportive, as a director.


We are in the end game.


I came into this world with nothing.


But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.


I am so upset.


The boat was fantastic.


I saw some good things.


Finally, he paid for the movie.


You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.


In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.


Three years ago he would have been.


You feel the pride.


It is so unfair.


The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.


Indeed, it was magical.


I've got no secret.


Look at the witnesses.


I'm very lucky.


We must do something.


He says that he is no different from any other man.


Alex Ferguson is the same.


I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.


Like his acting, it was an accident.


It is not like working for a living.


It is long gone.


The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.


Tell us about it.


The salary changes are long overdue.


He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.


It was very formal.


The pressure is on Celtic in the main.


Tyson is overwhelmed.


We are delighted at the response from potential employers.


I wanted to go out on a high.


Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.


I felt really good until Friday.


His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.


He could face a jail sentence.


For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.


I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.


I am not willing to say anything about any couple.


Then followed a bout of flu.


There is no signature.


It's a long process.


It is a large number.


He knew his job inside out.


I wouldn't want to miss that chance.


Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.


It does not even have a staff shortage.


I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.


He has the edge.


He denied the charge.


There were no casualties.


Since then, he has played no active part in the company.


YOU thought it was a headache.


Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.


A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.


They really did a great job.


There is a solution, she believes.


However, it's good to turn the page.


This year I understood.


I'm pleased about one thing.


It is unusual.


It is also claimed that he was murdered.


It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.


I can lead by example.


Well, it did last time, he was reminded.


They are good.


He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.


My husband was born in Zimbabwe.


So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.


It was on fire.


The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.


I never won a penny throughout my career.


Emotions were complex.


He's already made history.


So I did.


You ask the question.


Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.


There was no trouble.


This is a huge confidence boost.


Not because they want to sing about something.


It is not a standing army.


We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.


I believe the gap is nearly there.


You wanted the evidence.


Our numbers are small.


I was very young.


We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.


I am the Son of Sam.


She is superb.


Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.


It doesn't always work that way.


It is simple, but profound.


No preference emerged.


But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.


I've invented a village in East Lothian.


She has reached the top of her profession.


It goes with the job.


The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.


Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.


I recommend a tour.


We are delighted with this outcome.


I have so much respect for him.


We shall be victorious.


Rather than answer, she resigned.


War is not the action.


They said so that I would look good in uniform.


It's not about defining styles.


One must hope not!


It is marvellous.


But it may take some time to confirm the findings.


They should not be blamed for it.


Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.


It is bizarre.


Mary Archer is almost too clever.


I was just overwhelmed.


It had been in place since last July.


It's a miracle.


The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.


That was the first time I worked with Richard.


They will form a tribute.


The whole region is in shock.


The bill would be massive.
