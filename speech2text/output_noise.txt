
 Please call Stella.


 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.


 6 spoons of fresh snow peas, 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother,  Bob.


 She can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her Wednesday at,  the train station.


 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.


 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours.


 There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.


 People look, but no one ever finds them.


 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.


 Throughout the centuries, people have explained the rainbow in various ways.


 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.


 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.


 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.


 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.


 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.


 Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops,  which causes the rainbow.


 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.


 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops,,  and the width of the coloured band increases as the size of the drops increases.


 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of superimposition of a number of bows.


 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.


 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.


 Johnson was pretty low.


 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.


 They should be so lucky.


 Their courage and their honesty should be respected.


 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.


 It's a matter of balance.


 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.


 I would love it.


 It is marvelous.


 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.


 but it may take some time to confirm the findings.


 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.


 It was fit for royalty.


 I was scared.


 Dancing was her life.


 I suspect the latter.


 You must always attempt to raise the bar.


 But it took a lot of bottles.


 We will push.


 It is urgent.


 The judge said.


 It is difficult for Ali.


 But it might have done.


 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of AIDS.


 They had to explain it.


 Here's a clue.


 We were surprised to see the photograph.


 It's the bigger mission.


 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.


 It's very odd.


 Because we do not need it.


 It's not pretty, but it's effective.


 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.


 That's the truth.


 That is very hard alone.


 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.


 The problems are a result of that shortfall.


 You do not change overnight.


 People love to see this stuff.


 He was popular.


 I am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.


 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.


 It is like a river running by my home.


 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.


 There is an element of racism in Scotland.


 Painful, but only because it's true.


 That was the easy election.


 There could be a way back.


 Then followed about a flu.


 The press cuts are really exciting.


 I had my suspicions.


 It was chaotic.


 It is a job creation scheme.


 He is now a resident in England.


 I've got the shirt.


 Today she has been released.


 What has changed?


 That is bound to happen.


 I will miss him.


 It's all going to clear the debt.


 She had kept the news from him.


 No progress has been made.


 Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.


 Now the system is right behind us.


 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland office today.


 It is a lifeline.


 Today I couldn't run on it.


 However, it did not end that way.


 This time it will have opened up the field a little bit.


 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as Chairman of the Party.


 Then came the crunch.


 The oil companies would be asked to contribute.


 I wish I'd put on a brighter tie.


 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.


 It was mayhem.


 They were outside the circle.


 It was a good performance.


 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.


 There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.


 That is no use.


 It was really enjoyable on Saturday.


 While they went on holiday, we got the contract.


 He pleaded for caution.


 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.


 I don't have many friends.


 You had better believe it.


 It's not fair.


 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.


 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.


 Maybe this battle has been.


 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.


 Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.


 This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.


 It is rubbish.


 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.


 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.


 That's alright then.


 I'm so angry.


 Child abuse is a dreadful thing.


 It has removed a bit of guilt.


 Despite the result, it was still a great moment.


 The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.


 Up with the gold medal, he declined.


 That first victory made a huge difference to my career.


 I am now unemployed.


 If not, a deal could take many months.


 You've got to be vigilant.


 Our intentions are real.


 They took a risk.


 The goals were good.


 What will happen then?


 I am totally devoted to this job.


 He is severe.


 She died at her home.


 I don't want to have a fight with Mr. Hastings.


 They did very well.


 The home side didn't stand a chance.


 We want to see the maximum change.


 It was deployed in the Gulf War.


 Crucially, though, United was still alive.


 The departure of Mr Johnstone was reported by the Herald yesterday.


 She had gone to the Catholic school.


 It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.


 It was by the numbers.


 I was in daily contact.


 They were later discharged from hospital.


 This latter point is usually important.


 It is an attitude of mind.


 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.


 We have to move forward.


 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.


 We do not comment on the behavior of our authors.


 Tell it like it was.


 It is not too late to get on board.


 that must be left to the parole board.


 Again, we were lucky.


 Waiting times for these services are too long.


 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.


 We've made a couple of albums.


 My life has been destroyed.


 they thought they had found a home.


 It became a book by itself.


 I always felt they played for me.


 You've got to get people from all sorts of different directions.


 First and foremost, the game is entirely different.


 Blair's response was weak.


 It's the real thing for sure.


 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish prison service.


 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.


 The clarity is vital.


 I've been in two finals and I've got a medal.


 everyone can be bought.


 A career as a doctor is on hold.


 Mr. Doherty said the whole family was shocked.


 It is the whole package.


 I've been there.


 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.


 They receive a high profile in the media.


 We did everything by the book.


 I wish I could say something.


 The procedure is the same in all cases.


 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.


 I wanted to put myself on the line.


 I came home by ambulance.


 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of dress.


 The conference is the first test.


 The service from the other place was super.


 He is not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.


 On the outside of an airport it is very difficult.


 The sisters also became the top two players in the world.


 A deadline is still essential.


 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.


 It's a mixture of everything.


 We're not seeing an image of the person," he said.


 I don't want to use it.


 Now it's alright.


 There was an email.


 That's the day job.


 Feel the heat?


 He is slightly confused.


 She should not be blamed.


 His third goal was superb.


 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.


 It's not ideal.


 He seemed to lose his focus.


 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.


 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.


 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.


 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.


 That has been the easy part.


 We've got the bronze.


 Mental health is a massive issue.


 At the top of the structure will remain the post of head teacher.


 It was good fun!


 What was the main difference?


 I am immensely sad.


 I'd never seen a play about me.


 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.


 But she was.


 Her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.


 We were awful.


 However, no further action was taken by police.


 and thought we would get away with it.


 It is set in Paris.


 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.


 It's quite nice.


 It's quite a line up.


 It's a lovely, lovely film.


 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.


 Broke the birdie record.


 He claimed the government had lost the plot.


 She is well balanced.


 A change in that position would require a decision by the council.


 Jock Brown was appointed as general manager.


 He says that he is no different from any other man.


 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.


 We did not compete with any other local farmer.


 I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.


 Some families have even requested to leave the city.


 It's a record label, not a form of music.


 A friendship that will endure.


 I can't get a job.


 He said he intended to push for a judicial review.


 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.


 The bottom line is that we had to get a win.


 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.


 However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.


 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.


 Blood samples were taken.


 They want to shut the Scottish office.


 Their review will look at management across the sector as a whole.


 Of course, that is not the whole story.


 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.


 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.


 Brian is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.


 He is a young man with a new deal.


 He was also married with two children.


 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.


 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.


 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.


 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.


 They went to the club to make money.


 Finally, he paid for the movie.


 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.


 It's a way of life.


 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.


 I am an estate agent.


 The record companies have gone through the floor.


 They were on holiday in Egypt.


 It was a privilege to work with him.


 It happens from time to time.


 He looks very sharp.


 Surely the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.


 I saw it at a rock.


 They were all super sad themselves.


 The attacker died in the crash.


 The government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.


 A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.


 Police were on the scene within minutes but the killer had fled.


 It was obviously very genuine.


 These figures are truly awful.


 He should have won.


 He is retired.


 What has altered?


 I thought it was my only chance.


 Nothing is safe.


 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.


 They are wrong.


 It is a road of death.


 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.


 We are in the endgame.


 We are now looking at the degrees of injury.


 He was solid.


 Special measures were needed.


 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.


 I never thought it would take this long.


 We are a peaceful people.


 Kids are terrible.


 It should be equal.


 Greg is a major concern for us.


 The home team had an amazing start.


 For the moment our position remains the same.


 referees are easy target


 Davis is very supportive as a director.


 However, the groups denied the claims.


 I came into this world with nothing.


 We think all other measures are not exhausted.


 up with their heads.


 It's not long enough.


 My view has now completely changed.


 We also recovered a picture of a summer vinladi.


 We agreed to disagree.


 It could have gone either way.


 He was then replaced by Ross.


 Horses are drawn by ballot.


 I'd like to take the plunge.


 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.


 She did not attend the courtroom.


 It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.


 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.


 The team for the first game could be this one.


 They haven't got a hope.


 Who will do it?


 Gaelic provision continued to be good.


 That's not a fiction because he is not a tenant.


 He also insisted that no concessions had to be made to the French.


 He has to learn.


 Tiger is the exception.


 sex offender programs to be retained by public sector.


 That is the very reason why it was so vital.


 I could hardly move for the next couple of days.


 Chambers said he would accept the place.


 everything was inappet.


 The boat was fantastic.


 Like his acting, it was an accident.


 It is long gone.


 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.


 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.


 He had played well in that central role.


 It's not that clear cut.


 She is free.


 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.


 I kept going for her.


 You must have a government and a good civil service.


 But the real problem is the closure of the export market.


 It is a holiday program with a mortgage.


 however it was well worth the wait


 It benefits the whole family.


 He has seen the past.


 It was one in the afternoon.


 To do so, he reckons that a good opening result is essential.


 We will be homeless.


 The scene is about this.


 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.


 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.


 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.


 It was a double tragedy for the family.


 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.


 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.


 They have not done so this season so far.


 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.


 Well, the big day has arrived.


 Five members were disciplined.


 Talks are progressing.


 There is no signature.


 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.


 That left a bad taste in my mouth.


 It was as if it was all happening at the garden party.


 Ms McNeil was killed on impact.


 It has moved on in the last week.


 That's the name of the game though.


 You thought it was a headache.


 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.


 A council spokesman said it has been a constructive meeting.


 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.


 I can lead by example.


 I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.


 but they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.


 People are allowed home at lunchtime.


 It will probably take me just days to spend it.


 We knew nothing about it.


 My house was shaking at the time.


 This is a huge confidence boost.


 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.


 We should have known.


 Quality Meets Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.


 I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.


 You wanted the evidence.


 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.


 It was that bad, that low.


 I was very young.


 We've just got to keep his feet on the ground.


 Please call Stella.


 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.


 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.


 Dye oops, rydyn ni hefyd anor티a swch ifanc a chwch gymweith active.


 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.


 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours.


 These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends,  apparently beyond the horizon.


 There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.


 People look but no one ever finds it.


 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.


 Throughout the centuries people explained the rainbow in various ways.


 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.


 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.


 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.


 The Norsemen consider the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.


 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.


 Aristotle thought that the rainbow is caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.


 Yn ystod yno, mae'r ffisiadwr wedi teimlo bod hynny ddim yn ymdrech, ond yn ymdrech o'r rhainfroedd sy'n cael y rhainbôd.


 Mae llawer o syniadau cyfweliol am y bôr wedi eu creu.

 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.


 we have to pull together or we will hang apart.


 Is this accurate?


 Maen nhw'n rhaid i gydnabod gwirionedd ar y cyfnod ymlaen.


 because we do not need it.


 Life was like a timetable.


 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.


 It was clear.


 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.


 I came to complete.


 President Bush is at war.


 Of course, on Tuesday United were beaten despite this.


 I was scared.


 It was ugly.


 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.


 It's easiest to talk about these things in the abstract.


 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.


 A neighbour said.


 We need to chat.


 The boy is no longer with us.


 I hate the word.


 That should do it.


 It's a blessing.


 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of AIDS.


 fel mae'n ei ddweud.


 Yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.


 यह नहीं वाइन्ना


 I got a great response from the players as I had expected.


 but the law is very clear on this.


 In the meantime though, the signs are good.


 It was a surprise to see the photograph.


 Next league match is Celtic.


 It's very odd.


 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.


 It is not great art.


 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.


 There was a battle there.


 Scotland had great assets.


 There will be tough opponents to this report.


 Gadewch i ni edrych ar ein cyfrifiadau.


 Sounds like the sixth sense.


 There is an element of racism in Scotland.


 I was just trying to win the golf tournament.


 Mae'n un peth byddaf yn ei wneud.


 There could be a way back.


 Nid yw'r gwasanaethau Glasgow yng Nghymru.


 The price cuts are really exciting.


 Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.


 I have my suspicions.


 She died in hospital two hours later.


 It was chaotic.


 Is there any way forward?


 I've not thought about it.


 People must remain vigilant.


 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.


 It's not long term but I need time to recover.


 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.


 Mae'n gallu bod wedi bod.


 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.


 He seems to be pleased with the picture.


 Obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.


 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.


 It's never too late.


 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.


 Downing Street will make the second appointment at the Scotland office today.


 Yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.


 They are confined.


 You must look forward.


 It is an old family habit.


 He was possessed.


 She told the Herald.


 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.


 The peace process will be buried.


 that all companies would be asked to contribute.


 They are now divorced.


 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.


 It was mayhem.


 However, at the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.


 Tomorrow he will make a Q-Heart speech on Europe.


 Mae gennym argymell i Michelle.


 That time is not now, however.


 I didn't play well last year.


 For these people the ruling is very welcome.


 they will want to perform well.


 They had to be cut from the wreckage.


 I did not think about the Ryder Cup.


 It is normal.


 I was fighting for my life, I thought.


 I don't have many friends.


 It's a shame.


 It was the 80s.


 We do not expect any surplus.


 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.


 It's not only a concept in jazz.


 Rydyn ni'n ddiddorol i ddod â'r misi hwn a byddwn ni'n ymwneud.


 I'm delighted about that.


 Does this mean?


 This is the first big idea of a Scottish Parliament election.


 He did his job.


 You can spend money on housing.


 That's alright then.


 I was furious.


 Mae wedi'i ddysgu ychydig o'r cyd-ddyddiad.


 His son has been travelling with the Tartan army for years.


 It's terrible that he has died the same way.


 Felly y cyfnod Ewropeaidd yn bwysig iawn.


 F guarantee yw'r palais factories, i fod o benza fater cwm digwydd.


 Who will attend?


 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.


 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
